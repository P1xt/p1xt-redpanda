The following are my notes from when I watched The Net Ninja's
Angular 2 Playlist on Youtube.

Component based! Navbar is a component, Sidebar too, everything :)

Tutorial is in TypeScript.

Demo app created is Angular 2 (TypeScript) with a Firebase backend.

Editor in use is Atom with the following plugins:
platformio-ide-terminal
language-typescript-grammars-only

I also installed wakatime

### Setup

* first install node (I already had it installed, I'm running version 
7.20.0)
* `npm install -g angular-cli`
* Note: the Ninja said to setup the project wit `ng new projectname` but
I'd already created a git repo for it so I just cd'd into that and ran
`ng init`. Once that was finished, from the same directory I ran
`npm install` then, when that was finished, I ran `ng serve` and LO AND
BEHOLD when I browsed to `http://localhost:4200/` there was the cruddy
little do nothing starter Angular app!!!
