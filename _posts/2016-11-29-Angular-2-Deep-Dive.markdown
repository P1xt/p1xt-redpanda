I already have a rudimentary understanding of Angular 2. However,
one of my clients is looking to refactor an existing (large) application 
to more mainstream (current) technolgies, so I'm taking the next
week to "Deep Dive" into Angular 2 and boost up to expert level so
I can hit the ground running.

For anyone else interested in Angular 2, I'll be posting the resources 
I use, and the sample projects I create here, in case my learning path
might be a helpful blueprint for your own.
