Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally
similar to this: https://timestamp-ms.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to
Heroku.

User Story: I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to
see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural
language date (example: January 1, 2016).

User Story: If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the
natural language form of that date.

User Story: If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns
null for those properties.
