Just a quick proof of concept post to ensure I've managed to setup Jekyll properly. Leaving the boilerplate
links in the bottom of this so I can get back to the docs later and figure out how to theme all this properly :)



Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
